### <center>Problem Set 2</center>

In this project, we attempt to replicate the monthly return for risk-parity and other benchmark portfolios as described in "Clifford S Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H Pedersen. Leverage aversion and risk parity. Financial Analysts Journal, 68(1):47–59, 2012" using CRSP stocks, bonds and t-bill data between July-1926 to December 2023.

### <center>Problem Set 4</center>

In this project, we attempt to replicate the monthly size and book-to-market decile portfolios as defined in Fama and French (1992) and HML and SMB factors as defined in Fama and French (1993) using CRSP stocks and Compustat datasets between 1973 to 2023.
